## What Is CTL?
Code To Learn <small>(CTL for short)</small> is a community primarily aimed at college students undertaking Computer Science, Computer Engineering or any course equivalent that make use of writing code to solve problems. 

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide a platform where students can meet other people with similar interests and help each other every step of the way in the individual journeys of the members of the community. This is our mission statement: 
> *"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go with people."*

## Our Vision
We are looking forward to have people from various backgrounds, share different ideas and impact the local commuinities around us. Technology is not meant to replace humans, but rather help humans to be more efficient. We believe this can be best achieved as a group effort.
